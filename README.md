#DESCRIPTION ABOUT MY PROJECT


This project is created as part of CODTECH Internship , which focuses on learning and practicing **SQL JOIN operations**.  
The goal of this task is to understand how data from multiple tables can be combined meaningfully using different types of JOINs.

In this project:

- I created two tables: **students** and **courses**  
- Inserted sample records into both tables  
- Performed **INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, and FULL JOIN** operations  
- Displayed clear and easy-to-understand **outputs for each JOIN**  
- Explained how each JOIN behaves and when it should be used  

This project helps build strong fundamentals in relational databases, which are essential for backend development, analytics, and software engineering.

By completing this assignment, I practiced:

- Writing SQL queries  
- Understanding relationships between tables  
- Presenting data outputs  
- Organizing code clearly for GitHub  

This repository demonstrates my understanding of SQL JOINs and my ability to write clean and structured database queries.
